# My Udemy Course Studies
> Additional information or tagline

I'm taking a Udemy course and here is here I'm uploading the results.
This is a basic ReadMe that I'm learning to structure.

## Installing / Getting started

_template\ A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up &
running._

_template\ Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above._

### Initial Configuration

_template\ Some projects require initial configuration (e.g. access tokens or keys, `npm i`).
This is the section where you would document those requirements._

## Developing

_template\ Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:_

_template\ And state what happens step-by-step._

### Building

_template\ If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here:_

_template\ Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed._

### Deploying / Publishing

_template\ In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it._

_template\ And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does._

## Features

_template\ What's all the bells and whistles this project can perform?_
_* What's the main functionality_
_* You can also do another thing_
_* If you get really randy, you can even do this_

## Configuration

_template\ Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter when
using the project._

_State what an argument does and how you can use it. If needed, you can provide
an example below._

_Example:_
```bash
awesome-project "Some other value"  # Prints "You're nailing this readme!"
```

#### Argument 2
_Type: `Number|Boolean`_
_Default: 100_

_Copy-paste as many of these as you need._

## Contributing

_When you publish something open source, one of the greatest motivations is that
anyone can just jump in and start contributing to your project._

_These paragraphs are meant to welcome those kind souls to feel that they are
needed. You should state something like:_

_"If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and use a feature
branch. Pull requests are warmly welcome."_

_If there's anything else the developer needs to know (e.g. the code style
guide), you should link it here. If there's a lot of things to take into
consideration, it is common to separate this section to its own file called
`CONTRIBUTING.md` (or similar). If so, you should say that it exists here._

## Links

_Even though this information can be found inside the project on machine-readable
format like in a .json file, it's good to include a summary of most useful
links to humans using your project. You can include links like:_

_- Project homepage: https://your.github.com/awesome-project/_
_- Repository: https://github.com/your/awesome-project/_
_- Issue tracker: https://github.com/your/awesome-project/issues_
  _- In case of sensitive bugs like security vulnerabilities, please contact
    my@email.com directly instead of using issue tracker. We value your effort
    to improve the security and privacy of this project!_
_- Related projects:_
  _- Your other project: https://github.com/your/other-project/_
  _- Someone else's project: https://github.com/someones/awesome-project/_


## Licensing

_One really important part: Give your project a proper license. Here you should
state what the license is and how to find the text version of the license.
Something like:_

"The code in this project is licensed under MIT license."
